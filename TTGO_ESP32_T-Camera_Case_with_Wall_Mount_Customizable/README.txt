# Summary

Customizable case for the TTGO ESP32 T-Camera (ESP32 with camera, PIR motion sensor, OLED display and BME280 environmental sensor)

Here's the Ali link where I bought mine:
https://www.aliexpress.com/item/TTGO-T-Camera-ESP32-WROVER-PSRAM-Camera-Module-ESP32-WROVER-B-OV2640-Camera-Module-0-96/32968683765.html

There are STLs for the fisheye and the regular version, customize to your needs!

It is very likely that you have to customize the model because the position of PIR sensor, camera modules and buttons might differ slightly due to varying production quality ... 

Case front and back are connected by 4 M3x16mm countersunk screws. The screw holes in the front part need to be tapped.

Additional M3 screws are needed for the ball head mount.

Wall mount is designed for 4.5mm chipboard screws.

I added also an example YAML file for [ESPhome](https://esphome.io/). 
Remove the bme280 section if your board does not have one. 
I used this [Google font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P) to display a smiley on the screen when the PIR detects motion - download or adapt the font as you like.
