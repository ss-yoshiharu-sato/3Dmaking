BUGS, missing pieces, other things to do:
- cyl_block nibbles can't handle top_r < 2 and rational numbers
- a pilar with both supports for bottom and top (i.e. 2x4 directions)
- replace support by triangle_forward, triangle_right, etc.
- test STL merging with both Lego models

Authors:
- Original version 1 by Daniel K. Schneider, TECFA, University of Geneva, March 2010
- refactored version 2 by Daniel M. Taub, CEMI.org, October 2012, January 2013
- minor changes version 2.2 by Daniel K. Schneider, TECFA, University of Geneva, Feb 2017
- based on parametric lego duplo (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1778) by Domonoky
- based on OpenSCAD Bitmap Fonts Module (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2054) by Tony Buser.

This code is derived from two original works: 
1) Domonoky's parametric lego duplo - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1778. 
  I got the idea, and then kept some of the fine parts (nibbles, walls, etc,)
2) Tony Buser's OpenSCAD Bitmap Fonts Module - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2054

Legal disclaimer: 
- This is nor Duplo(TM) nor Lego(TM) nor Nano (TM). 
The bricks are called Doblo or Lugo and to fit Duplo (TM) and Lego (TM) and Nano (TM) more or less.

Purposes:
 - Creation of 3D duplo-compatible "play" boards for various purposes from Kindergarten to Master level
 - Introduction to 3D environnment (learn about positions) and use of OpenSCAD
 - "End-user 3D programming" environment (e.g. students could add other primitives)

Coordinate system and units:

Software needed:
- http://openscad.org/
- http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual
Once you installed openscad, then you may have a glance at the manual. Otherwise, just know this:
 - To compile a .scad file (see the result)
   1. Menu: File->Open
   2. menu: Design->Compile
 - To render for real and to export
   1. menu: Design-> Compile and Render (CGAL) .... this can take many minutes.
   2. menu: Design-> Export as .STL 

Usage:
 (1) Create a new .scad file or start from doblo-factory-examples.scad
 (2) Import this file:
     include doblo-factory.scad
 (3) Set the SCALE variable
 (4) Then, either write custom modules to create any combinations of
 block forms and imported STL or use the merge_brick standard module
 to pile up 3 objects: a doblo, a block and one imported STL

 See examples files in the top-level directory or the more ambitious projects in the ext directory

Printing:
 - To print larger structures be aware of warping. For ABS, use a draft and glue, for PLA you could use some glue for wide structures.
  
 - If you need good DUPLO/LEGO compatibility, you will have to print with 0.25 (or smaller) layers !
 - Large structures can take many hours to print. 

To create your own more complex custom shapes, there are several modules (functions). For example:

(1) The doblo brick. 
Typically, to create a Duplo or Lego compatible block use the doblo function:

module doblo (col, row, up, width,length,height,nibbles_on_off,scale)
