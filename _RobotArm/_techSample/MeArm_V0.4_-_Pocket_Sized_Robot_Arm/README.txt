# Instructions

The v0.4 is a tweaked step up from the v0.3.   
Full [build instructions at instructables!](http://www.instructables.com/id/Pocket-Sized-Robot-Arm-meArm-V04/)  
   
Parts list differs slightly from v0.3 and has been recently revised (previous v0.4 counts in brackets). We think this is now the optimal loadout, most tolerant to the differences in the thickness of acrylics as supplied by perspex.
