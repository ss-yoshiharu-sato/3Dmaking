# Summary

This is a 3D printed robotic Arm.
It follows the success of my previous two designs: <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1015238">EEZYbotARM</a> and <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1454048">EEZYbotARM Mk2</a>

It has the same dimensions of the first one, so it is extremely cheap and fast to print only the main base requires a little bit more time to be printed.

This version was created with the willingness to replace the servo with economic stepper motors, and this is the result. 
During development I found the stepper a little weak for the purpose, so I redesigned the transmissions on vertical arms, and apply a modification on stepper from unipolar to bipolar.

As the previous two arms it has been designed without a definite purpose, the aim is educational, providing a suitable hardware that allow to concentrate on exploring all its potential applications.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: Prusa Clone
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Doesn't Matter
Resolution: 0,3
Infill: 30%

Notes: 
All pieces are designed to avoid supports and orientered correctly, so you can disable them. This decrease the printing time and avoid post printing finishing

# Post-Printing

## Adjustment

As for previous designs I prefer to get all holes slightly tight. That to adjust the holes diameter using an exact drill bit allowing to recover any kind of possible misalignements and also to use non metric screws.

# BOM

Here following the list of parts necessary to built the MK3 robotic arm.
You need some 3D prinded parts and some commercial items.

# Assembly

## Assembly tips

On screws are to be used selflocking nuts. They are to be tightened till the locking of the joint, then consequently you have to loose them until you obtain a smooth movement with the lower clearance between components. On the two axis of the main vertical.arm I used M4 threaded rods

An important thing is that you have to made the conversion from unipolar 5wires 28BYJ-48 stepper motor to bipolar 4wires to increase the torque output. There are several tutorials on the web how to make it.

At this time I do not had time to make available an assembly instruction, I'll try to make one available soon.

SOFTWARE
As for the previous issues, there are several ways to drive the arm. It depends on what kind of results you want to obtain.
Mainly depends if you want to freely move it or make it repeat a loop.
At this time I do not have developed a software I've only made movements test using different hardware like CNC shield or easy driver. 
Remember that after the modification of stepper you cannot use ULN2300 drivers 

# Final Notes

This is a non commercial license.
I do not earn money on making it. I spend money and time (that for me is the greatest wealth) so please do not sell it without permission, and if you share provide attribution.

This encourage me to to develop more things like this.
