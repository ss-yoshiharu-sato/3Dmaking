# Post-Printing

## Putting it together

Other Parts
-LM8UU, Linear bearing , 2 ea.
-8mm Linear rod, 49mm long , 2 ea.
-M3 screw, 20mm long, 1 ea.
-M3 nut, 7 ea.
-Hobby Servo, I used a Dynam B2232
-Sparkfun servo trigger, 1 ea.
-4N36 Optocoupler, 1ea.

Assembly
To recess the M3 nuts into the plastic: Thread a M3 nut a few turns onto the end of a 20 mm screw. Heat the nut for a few seconds with a torch / lighter. While holding 20 mm screw press into the hex holes. ** once at desired depth quickly cool plastic with water.

 Press in the LM8UU linear bearings into the pen cart. Use an 8 mm drill bit to correctly size the linear rod holes. Set the pen cart inside the frame. Press the linear rods through the bottom of the frame through the linear bearings then back into the frame.

For the remaining parts:
 ( use small drillbit to pre-drill, use small screws to attach components)

Mount your servo inside the top of the frame with the shaft facing left. 
Mount the servo trigger wherever you choose. you may choose to mount it remotely and run servo wires to pen attachment.

Use the knob of your choice with the printed spring to connect to the pen cart.
** I recommend connecting the spring linkage only after powering up the servo trigger
   and setting the servo positions.
